VR Music Visualization Program

You need an HTC Vive VR headset to play (though you can try with an Oculus Rift).

Please insert your own music in .ogg format into the Music folder (/SoundFields Executable/KiteDemo/Music).

Press the menu button (above the touchpad) on the Vive's motion controller to toggle the UI. Point on a button and press the trigger to select.
